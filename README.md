# Millow

This python application requires the libraries MIDIUtil, Pillow, and tqdm (computation progress bar).

To load an image, the filename is hard coded near the top of main.py. Millow is currently under development. I am planning to use either command line parameters or a GUI for users to input their image files.

The output MIDI file will be saved to your project folder as millow.mid
